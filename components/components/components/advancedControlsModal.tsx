// This file is a duplicate due to casing. This content is removed to resolve module resolution errors during compilation.
// FIX: This module now correctly re-exports the canonical component to prevent build and runtime errors.
// FIX: Chained re-export to resolve casing conflict.
// FIX: Standardized export to point to the canonical PascalCase file, ensuring a single consistent module path.
// FIX: Corrected path to point to the canonical component at the root `components` directory.
